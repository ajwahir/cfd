## This project is for code.fun.do ShowCase 2018

This is a platform for Smart Cognitive and Health Monitoring.
When, a person is front of the computer and webcam is not in use, we us computer vision techniques monioter a person's mood,
pulse rate and track his/her eye-gaze to check if he is distrcted.

All the features are modular and can be activated according to the need

Its web-based gui and have real time pulse rate monitoring system with real-time plot and can be accessible by the doctors
for continious monitoring of the emotions and pulse.

More modules can be added, depending on the application.

The estimation of non-contact pulse rate has lot of uses. Pulse rate has to be monitored
frequently all the time to understand any symptom at an early stage. People donâ€™t like
wearing something all the time. So, there is a need for some non-contact device that
could monitor the pulse all the time. So, we tried to make a device that detects pulse rate
using head motion by trying to implement one and integrated them here.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Python 2.7
openCV
flask
azure.storage.blob

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

To get the framework running

```
git clone https://github.com/ajwahir/cfd
python pulse.py
```
That will start your pulse monitor with gaze tracking
Then, in a new terminal,
```
python home.py
```
This will run the web container and then in a new terminal
```
python emotions.py
```
which will start your congnitive monitor
```
firefox static/index.html

```
and you will have your gui up and running then.


## Running the tests
